    Enter file name here if you want Jenkins to convert fitnesse results to Junit results for representing, publishing or processing. Example filename :  fitnesse-result-junit.xml.
    Currently the file is written to the Jenkins workspace. The resultant file can be used to publish as Junit result or can be processed further like any other junit builds (archiving, generate html report, sending via email etc.).
